Top-down view of a dungeon floor, stone brick tiles viewed from directly above at a slight angle, warm torchlight illuminating the stone floor, atmospheric fog in the distance, dark fantasy dungeon aesthetic, the floor takes up most of the frame with subtle wall edges visible at the periphery, painterly game art style, warm orange torch glow on the stone surface
```

## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
Square 1:1 top-down view of a dark fantasy dungeon floor, painterly game art style. The central 60% safe zone holds the primary focus, featuring detailed weathered stone brick tiles heavily illuminated by warm orange torch glow, revealing rich texture and cracks. The area outside this central zone gradually fades into dense atmospheric fog and deep shadow, with blurred, indistinct edges of dungeon walls barely visible at the far periphery, ensuring seamless transitions when cropped horizontally or vertically. Full scene, no characters, no UI elements.
