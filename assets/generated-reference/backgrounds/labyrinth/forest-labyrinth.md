## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
A square 1:1 aspect ratio painterly game background in a dark fantasy art style, designed for multi-aspect cropping. The central 60% safe zone contains the key focal point: an ancient, moss-covered stone archway dungeon entrance partially hidden by thick vines, nestled deep within an enchanted forest labyrinth. Twisted trees with intensely glowing magical blue-green roots and varied bioluminescent mushrooms and flowers line the immediate path leading to the central archway. Dappled sunlight filters through the dense canopy, highlighting this central area. The outer 20% periphery on all sides transitions smoothly into atmospheric, less distinct elements, featuring heavy mysterious fog rolling between repetitive, blurred tree trunks and deep forest shadows that fade into indistinct greenery and earth tones, ensuring a seamless feel when cropped horizontally or vertically. Deep greens, muddy browns, and magical cyan-blue glow dominate the palette. No characters, no UI elements.
