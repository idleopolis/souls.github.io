## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
Square 1:1 composition game background asset, painterly fantasy game art style. A dark stone dungeon corridor with strong one-point perspective is centered, with the vanishing point and primary path contained within the central 60% safe zone. Ancient weathered stone brick walls and a foreshortened cobblestone floor are warm and torch-lit in the foreground center, receding into atmospheric fog and cool dark blues towards the infinite darkness in the back creating an illusion of depth. The outer edges of the square frame are heavily vignetted, shadowy, and blurred with mist to ensure seamless cropping for various aspect ratios, making the ceiling and far side walls less distinct. Moody atmospheric lighting, seamless 2D background suggesting 3D depth. No characters, no UI elements, no text.
