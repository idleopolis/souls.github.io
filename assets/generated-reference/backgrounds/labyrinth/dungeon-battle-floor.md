## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
Square 1:1 composition, viewed from a 60-degree angle from horizontal, showing an ancient weathered stone dungeon floor with sharp, consistent detail throughout the entire image from edge to edge. Cracked stone tiles with moss and dirt between them cover the whole frame. Glowing orange and purple-blue magical runes are etched into stones across the entire floor, concentrated more heavily in the center 60% but present with equal detail and brightness extending to all four edges. Warm torchlight from multiple small flames casts a uniform glow across the entire floor, with no darkened corners, vignette, or atmospheric fading at the edges. Scattered chains, broken pottery shards, bones, and debris are spread across the entire scene, with more dense clusters in the central safe zone and continuing with full clarity to the periphery. Pillar bases are visible at the very corners of the square frame. Dark fantasy RPG painterly art style with full, sharp detail everywhere and no blur.
