## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
Square 1:1 fantasy RPG painterly style illustration of a dungeon battle corridor, designed with a central safe zone for cropping. The primary view, contained within the center 60% of the frame, is a 60-degree angle looking down into an ancient, weathered stone passageway. This central path features detailed stone floor tiles with cracks, moss, scattered chains, debris, and old pottery. Glowing runes etched into some stones emit a magical purple ambient light that mixes with the warm orange glow cast by torches mounted on the stone brick walls, all concentrated in this central area. The corridor extends forward into the distance, creating depth within the safe zone. The outer edges of the square composition, including the upper arched ceiling structure, the far left and right wall sections, and the immediate bottom foreground, transition smoothly into darker, more shadowed, and less detailed atmospheric textures, designed to be cropped seamlessly without losing key elements. The lighting falls off towards these peripheral areas, maintaining a dark, atmospheric mood. Sharp, painterly details are focused in the center, with softer, blended transitions at the frame's periphery. No characters, no UI elements, no text.
