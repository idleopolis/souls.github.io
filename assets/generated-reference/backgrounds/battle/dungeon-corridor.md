## Full Prompt (sent to API)

```
Square 1:1 aspect ratio composition designed for flexible cropping. The central 60% safe zone holds the primary focus: a perspective view looking down a narrow dark fantasy dungeon corridor lined with ancient Gothic stone arches, leading to a mysterious central dark archway opening into absolute darkness. Warm, dramatic torchlight from sources just within the safe zone illuminates the immediate path, casting long shadows and orange highlights on the cold grey stone floor with subtle tile patterns and mossy central walls. The outer 20% peripheral areas on all top, bottom, and side edges fade seamlessly into deep, indistinct atmospheric shadow, heavy fog, blurred generic ancient stonework, and indistinct cobwebs to allow for safe cropping at the boundaries without losing critical scenery or breaking immersion. Painterly RPG game digital art style, medieval atmosphere, no characters, no text, no UI elements.
