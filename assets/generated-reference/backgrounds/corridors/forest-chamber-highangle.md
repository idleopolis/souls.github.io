A first-person photograph looking down a long, high-angle three-quarter view looking down into an ancient forest dungeon chamber with overgrown stone ruins corridor. The floor is paved with rough flagstones, providing a clear path in the center. The walls are made of large, weathered stone blocks with arches and pillars. dappled sunlight filtering through the forest canopy above, casting pools of golden light and soft shadows on the floor casts long shadows. The atmosphere is the vanishing point is high in the frame showing depth below the viewer, isometric RPG perspective, looking down at approximately 45-60 degree angle, with a faint mist in the distance. the focus is on the detailed forest floor with grass patches, exposed tree roots, scattered fallen leaves, ancient moss-covered stone pillars and vine-draped archways along the sides. The vanishing point is in the center of the frame. Cinematic lighting. Highly detailed, photorealistic. No characters, no UI elements, no text.
