## Prompt

```
A first-person photograph looking down a long, overgrown forest path through ancient ruins with moss-covered stone archways corridor. The floor is paved with rough flagstones overtaken by grass and roots, providing a clear path in the center. The walls are made of large, weathered stone blocks with arches and pillars covered in vines. Dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy above, golden rays piercing the foliage casts long shadows. The atmosphere is mysterious and enchanted, ancient and overgrown, with a faint mist in the distance. Hanging vines, ferns growing between cracked stones, glowing fireflies in the shadows. The vanishing point is in the center of the frame. Cinematic lighting. Highly detailed, photorealistic. No characters, no UI elements, no text.
