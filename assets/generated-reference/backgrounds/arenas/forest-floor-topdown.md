```
A top-down photograph of an ancient, weathered dungeon floor. The surface is made of old weathered stone flagstones overgrown with grass, moss, and forest vegetation, some cracked with roots growing through. a clear flat area of ancient stone tiles surrounded by encroaching forest floor dominates the center of the image. fallen leaves, small mushroom clusters, wildflowers, scattered twigs, patches of clover are scattered across the floor. dappled warm sunlight filtering through an unseen forest canopy above, creating soft shadows that give depth to the cracks in the stone highlights the rough texture of the stone. The composition is centered on a clear area of the floor where combat can take place. Highly detailed, 8k resolution, photorealistic. No characters, no UI elements, no text.
