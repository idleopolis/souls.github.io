## Prompt

```
Create a complete tilemap PNG for an enchanted forest labyrinth game in a consistent top-down painterly art style. All tiles must be perfectly aligned to a 64×64 grid, seamless, and game-ready.

Include:
Tileable forest floor (3-4 variants with grass, dirt, moss)
Shadowed floor variant
Worn path / dirt patch

All maze wall tiles: straight (horizontal/vertical), inner corners (TL/TR/BL/BR), outer corners (TL/TR/BL/BR), T-junctions (up/down/left/right), cross junction, dead ends (U/D/L/R) - walls should be dense hedge/vine walls with twisted branches

Decorative tiles: glowing mushrooms, magical rune stones, ancient tree stumps with fairy lights, mossy boulders, vines, roots, bushes, fallen logs, small flowers, torches with green flame

Optional FX tiles: soft forest fog, magical sparkle overlay, dappled light beam

Requirements:
Pure transparent background
All tiles arranged cleanly in rows/columns with identical spacing
Identical perspective and lighting across all tiles
No text, labels, characters, UI, or borders
Clean, cohesive, game-ready painterly fantasy style
Soft ambient forest lighting with magical blue-green glow accents
No baked-in shadows on floor tiles
Output: A single tilemap image containing all tiles listed above
```
