## Prompt

```
A single square tile for a truchet pattern system. Dark aged parchment background. A single curved line or arc drawn in faded sepia/brown ink, going from the center of one edge to the center of an adjacent edge (like a quarter circle in one corner). Hand-drawn ink style with rough edges. The line should clearly start and end at the exact center of two adjacent edges. Simple, elegant, mysterious. No other decorations - just the one curved connector line on parchment.
