**Tool:** retheme_image
**Output:** `/home/josh/idleopolis/game/ui/public/assets/generated/tilesets/labyrinth/forest-runes-tilemap.png`

## Prompt

```
Transform into seamless connecting maze-like rune patterns. CRITICAL: Every tile must have the SAME edge pattern on all four sides - lines/paths that exit at the center of each edge so ANY tile can connect to ANY other tile seamlessly. Create variations of: curved connectors, straight crossings, T-junctions, corner turns, spiral centers, knot intersections. Hand-drawn ink style on aged parchment. Dark sepia/brown lines on tan background. Each tile is a fragment of an infinite labyrinth - mysterious pathways that continue endlessly when tiles are placed randomly next to each other. Like truchet tiles or celtic knot fragments.
