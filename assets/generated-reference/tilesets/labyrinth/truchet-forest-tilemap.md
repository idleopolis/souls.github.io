## Prompt

```
STRICT REQUIREMENTS - This is a tilemap that must tile seamlessly:

1. VINES: Transform the green curved lines into mossy forest vines. The vines MUST follow the EXACT same curved paths as the original image - do not move, add, or remove any curves. Just restyle them as organic woody vines with glowing green moss.

2. BACKGROUND: Replace the dark background with a uniform dark green grass/moss texture. The texture must be IDENTICAL at all tile edges for seamless tiling - no leaves, mushrooms, or debris near the edges. Any forest details (small leaves, twigs) should only appear in the CENTER of each tile, away from edges.

3. TILING: This is an 8x8 grid of 128px tiles. Each tile edge must match its neighbors perfectly. Keep the background simple and uniform.
